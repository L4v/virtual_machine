# A prototype little Virtual Machine, coded entirely in C

## Why?
Why not.

To run the editor (emacs) with custom init.el, cd to root dir
and run:
```
. editor.sh
```

The terminal will automatically be redirected to the build/ dir
The program can be compiled with the F5 hotkey which will automatically
execute the build.sh, if not using emacs, cd to the code/ dir and
run:

```
./build.sh
```
